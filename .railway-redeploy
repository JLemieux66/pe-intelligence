# Forces Railway to rebuild and clear Python bytecode caches

Deployment timestamp: 2025-11-10T23:45:00Z
Reason: Clear .pyc caches and deploy ML encoding fixes
Commit: Force fresh deployment after PR #16 merge

IMPORTANT: This deployment includes critical ML fixes:
- Categorical encoding with proper type conversion
- Pandas deprecation warnings resolved
- 'Unknown' string handling fixed
- Logging verbosity reduced

All fixes are in commit df8214b which is now on main.
Railway needs to clear .pyc caches to pick up the changes.
